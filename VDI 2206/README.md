The VDI 2206 (Design methodology for mechatronic systems) according to [1] contains concepts for the description of mechatronic systems
and their containment structure. Hereby, the guideline defines necessary constituents of a mechatronic ssystem as well as a description
on how they are related. Figure 1 shows the lightweight ontology of the VDI 2206.

As the VDI 2206 does not define any inheritance concepts, but it provides concepts to general for direct use, the parent-child
concept introduced in [2] can be applied to overcome this modelling issue. Here, any member of any class of the VDI 2206 can be also 
member of one of the classes shown in Figure [2], in order to enable inheritance.
